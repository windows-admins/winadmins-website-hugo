Congratulations to the WinAdmins Community which passed [6,000 members](membercount-2021-08-12.png) as of 2021-08-12!

Some fun facts:

* We grew from 4,000 members to 6,000 members in 10 months, averaging 50 new members per week.
* Over 52,000 messages were sent in the past 30 days.
* There were over 22,000 "speaking minutes" in our voice channels in the past 30 day.
* We recently added the `#shameless-self-promotion` channel, to encourage members to highlight any cool things they may have done.

On behalf of the administration and moderation teams, thanks for joining and hanging around. We're happy to see all of the collaboration that goes on here, and all of the cool things that you folks come up with and share with the community, to make us all better admins.

Happy Friday, cheers! 🍺
